What is Digital Boards and its benefits?
Overview


Digital Boards is a collection of project activities displayed in the form of cards, which helps to comment and update activities more easily.

Digital boards encompass a collection of tasks generated through two distinct processes: the Clone and Create method (Automatic) and the Custom method (Manual).

Boards can be conveniently viewed in a card format, providing a user-friendly interface.

These digital boards facilitate various functions such as viewing tasks for the current sprint, enhancing productive scrum calls, and enabling inline editing of task’s status.

This streamlined approach allows users to access a comprehensive list of boards, each associated with various modules. Additionally, creating new boards is effortless and user-friendly.

After a board is being created, users have the flexibility to modify it according to the specific requirements of new tasks or items.

They can customize the board's parent tasks, select only the necessary columns for easy viewing, and apply filters based on their specific needs.

This level of customization empowers users to optimize their board layouts and configurations for enhanced productivity.

This efficiently enables users to save time, ensure consistency, and streamline project workflows, resulting in increased productivity.

Types of Boards

In Digital Projects, the following are the three types of boards:

(i). Active Boards: “Active Boards” refers to the specific boards that are currently active.



(ii). C & C Boards: The “C & C Boards” contain all the boards that have been created through the Clone and Create process.



(iii). Custom Boards: : “Custom Boards” refers to personalized and tailored boards created by the user for their own to-do lists and reminders.
